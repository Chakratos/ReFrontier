# ReFrontier
Tools for *packing, *crypting and editing various Monster Hunter Frontier Online files.

Repo made public as of 07/17/2019 on occasion of the game in question being shutdown in a few months. Tool was intended for personal use only, so it might be a bit messy to foreign eyes. You're likely looking for ReFrontier itself and can safely ignore the other tools.

Huge thank you to enler for their help!
